Here's a short video about some of the work I've been up to lately (courtesy of Stanford Libraries).

## Professional & research experience 

### December 2015 - Present: [Stanford Libraries](https://library.stanford.edu/)

_Head Librarian and Bibliographer, [Harold A. Miller Library](https://library.stanford.edu/hopkins)_
My main goals are to:
1. support excellence in research by any means necessary, with physical and virtual library spaces and collections;
2. facilitate effective stewardship and curation of information and data generated by the research community at Hopkins Marine Station;
3. extend the preservation efforts of HMS archive collections to create actionable research products, thus broadening their utility and impact; and,
4. share the remarkable work of Hopkins researchers with our local community through meaningful engagement with diverse audiences.

I am responsible for the overall management of the Harold A. Miller Library at [Hopkins Marine Station](https://hopkinsmarinestation.stanford.edu/). I make purchase decisions for books, journals, and electronic resources in marine sciences. I help Hopkins residents find the information they need, procure documents not available on site or online, and provide instruction on use of physical and virtual library resources and spaces. I manage and support use of our fabrication space. I also provide research services, including consultations on data management, sharing and curation. I manage the Miller Library's web pages and Facebook presence.
