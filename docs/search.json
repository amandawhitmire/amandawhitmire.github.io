Miller Library My main goals are to: 1. support excellence in research by any means necessary, with physical and virtual library spaces and collections; 2. facilitate effective stewardship and curation of information and data generated by the research community at Hopkins Marine Station; 3. extend the preservation efforts of HMS archive collections to create actionable research products, thus broadening their utility and impact; and, 4. share the remarkable work of Hopkins researchers with our local community through meaningful engagement with diverse audiences.\nI am responsible for the overall management of the Harold A. Miller Library. I make purchase decisions for books, journals, and electronic resources in marine sciences. I help Hopkins residents find the information they need, procure documents not available on site or online, and provide instruction on use of physical and virtual library resources and spaces. I also provide research services, including consultations on data management, sharing and curation. I manage the Miller Library’s web pages and Facebook presence.\nAssistant to the Director, Hopkins Marine Station. In my role as Assistant to the Director of the Station, I help with fundraising, publicity, and tours.\n2012 - 2015: Oregon State University Libraries and Press\nAssistant Professor, Data Management Specialist.\nJan. 2012 – Aug. 2012: Oregon State University, Research Associate (post-doctoral), College of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences.

      "contents": "\nI am an oceanographer-turned-librarian with a passion for rescuing old data. Observations from the past are critical in being able to put current changes into context. We can’t go back in time to make observations over again - we must preserve and share as much as we can before it’s lost. In my work as a librarian, I am able to merge my experience in marine science research with new skills in digital curation. I believe in open science, open data, and the power of text files.\nCurrently I am Head Librarian & Bibliographer of the Harold A. Miller Library, and Assistant to the Director of Hopkins Marine Station at Stanford University. I am also an elected official, serving as a Trustee on the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District Board of Education for Trustee Area 3 (Monterey; 2018-2022). I am a mom, a jack of all trades, and a keeper of chickens.\nPreviously I was an Assistant Professor, Data Management Specialist with OSU Libraries & Press at Oregon State University. I developed and taught a 2-credit, graduate-level course in research data management, and was PI on an IMLS-funded project to develop a tool to standardize the review of NSF data management plans.\n\n\n\n",
