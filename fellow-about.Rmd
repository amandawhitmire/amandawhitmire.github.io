This site is a place to document and share the work I'll be doing for my 2021 LEADING Fellowship Project, "From natural history literature to linked open data biodiversity knowledge graph." See the about page for more information about the fellowship program.

My fellowship project is housed under the Academy of Natural Sciences (ANSP) of Drexel University, and will be using the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. This project seeks to augment existing biodiversity specimen collection data by linking related descriptions found in the rich tradition of natural history literature.

The [*LIS Education and Data Science Integrated Network Group (LEADING)*](https://cci.drexel.edu/mrc/leading/), is a Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian (LB21) National Digital Infrastructures and Initiatives project, supported by the [Institute of Museum and Library Services](https://www.imls.gov/) (IMLS). The LEADING project scales-up the highly successful [LEADS-4-NDP](https://cci.drexel.edu/mrc/research/leads/) initiative and will prepare a diverse, nation-wide cohort of 50 LIS doctoral students and early to mid-career librarians for data science endeavors.
